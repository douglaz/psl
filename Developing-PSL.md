### Setting up your environment
#### Cloning the PSL repository
If you are already comfortable using [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and you don't want or need to push commits to GitHub, then you can just clone the PSL repository.

For read-only access:
```
>> git clone git://github.com/linqs/psl.git
```
For read-write access:
```
>> git clone git@github.com:linqs/psl.git
```
