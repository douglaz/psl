#Welcome to the wiki for the Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) software. 


##Getting Started
To get started with PSL you can follow one of these guides: 
- _If_  you are new to PSL we suggest that you start with our Command Line Interface (CLI), which allows you to write a complete model in a simple text file. [[Command Line Interface for New Users | GettingStarted:CLI]] 

<Beginning PSL for New Users

Basic PSL for Beginners GettingStarted:CLI>

- _If_  you are comfortable with Java/Groovy, and want to get your hands dirty with advanced modeling capabilities we recommend that you use our Groovy interface. [[Groovy for Intermediate Users | Getting Started with Groovy]] 

<Or Groovy for People with Programming Background
PSL for Users with Coding Experience

- _If_ you plan on using PSL for your own applications, and will need direct access to Java, refer to this guide.

PSL requires Java, so before you start make sure that you have [[Java|https://java.com/en/download/]] installed. 

##Learn More About PSL
PSL is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models developed by the Statistical Relational Learning Group [[ LINQS | http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/]] at the University of Maryland and the University of California Santa Cruz. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. If you would like to start by reading papers and projects using PSL, try the [ PSL homepage | http://psl.umiacs.umd.edu ]

##[[Migration Guide | Migrating to PSL 2]]
We are improving PSL all the time, and now have two versions! If you are migrating from PSL 1.0 to 2.0 please refer to our Migration Guide.

Welcome to the wiki for the PSL software from the University of Maryland. 

[Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)](https://psl.umiacs.umd.edu) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, and computer vision.
