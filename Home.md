Welcome to the wiki for the Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) software. 

PSL is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models developed by the Statistical Relational Learning Group [[ LINQS | http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/]] at the University of Maryland and the University of California Santa Cruz. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. 

To get started with PSL you can follow one of these guides: 
- Basic guide for beginners. If you are new to PSL we suggest that you start with our Command Line Interface (CLI), which allows you to write a complete PSL model in a simple text file. [[Command Line Interface for new users | GettingStarted:CLI]]
- If you are comfortable with Java/Groovy, and want to get your hands dirty with complete PSL modeling capabilities we recommend that you use our Groovy interface.  [[Groovy for power users | Getting Started with Groovy]]
- If you plan on using PSL for your own applications, and will need direct access to Java, please refer to our guide: [[Java for application developers | GettingStarted:Java]].

For all users, you need Java. Here's are instructions to [download and install Java | prereqs:InstallingJava]

Welcome to the wiki for the PSL software from the University of Maryland. 

[Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)](https://psl.umiacs.umd.edu) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, and computer vision.
