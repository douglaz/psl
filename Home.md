Welcome to the wiki for the Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) software. PSL is developed by the Statistical Relational Learning Group [[ LINQS | http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/]] at the University of Maryland and the University of California Santa Cruz.  

First note: PSL has multiple interfaces
- [[Command Line Interface for new users | GettingStarted:CLI]]
- [[Groovy for power users | GettingStarted:Groovy]]
- [[Java for application developers | GettingStarted:Java]]

For all users, you need Java. Here's are instructions to [download and install Java | prereqs:InstallingJava]

If you would like to start by reading papers and projects using PSL, try the [ PSL homepage | http://psl.umiacs.umd.edu ]

Welcome to the wiki for the PSL software from the University of Maryland. 

[Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)](https://psl.umiacs.umd.edu) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, and computer vision.
