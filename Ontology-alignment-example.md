After [[building and installing| building-psl]] the PSL software we are now ready to run an example PSL program.  PSL examples are found in the psl-examples package.  Inside this package you will find the ```OntologyAlignment.groovy``` example.  First, navigate to the parent directory of the `OntologyAlignment.groovy` example:  
  

````
>> cd <local path to psl-examples>/src/main/java/edu/umd/cs/psl/example  
````     
  
Here, you will find `OntologyAlignment.groovy'. This example gives an instance of using PSL for [[Ontology Alignment | http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_alignment]].
