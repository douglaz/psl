Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) is a general purpose software for modeling probabilistic and relational domains, and could be used for a wide variety of applications such as link prediction and ontology alignment. PSL combines the strengths of two powerful theories -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Foundations-Artificial-Intelligence-Genesereth/dp/0934613311">logic</a> with its ability to succinctly represent complex phenomena, and <a href="http://pgm.stanford.edu/">probabilistic graphical models</a> with their ability to represent the uncertainty and incompleteness inherent in real-world knowledge. More concretely, PSL uses "soft" logic as its logical component and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_random_field">Markov networks</a> as its statistical model. 

In "soft" logic, logical constructs need not be strictly false(0) or true(1) but can take on values between 0 and 1 inclusive. For example, in logical formula `similarNames(X,Y) => sameEntity(X,Y)` (which encodes that if two persons `X` and `Y` have similar names, then they are the same person),  the truth value of `similarNames(X,Y)` and that of the entire formula lie in the range [0,1]. The logical operators `and(^)`, `or(v)` and `not(~)`  are defined using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%81ukasiewicz_logic">Lukasiewicz t-norms</a>, i.e., 

`A ^ B = max{A+B-1,0}`<br>
`A v B = min{A+B,1}`<br>
`~A = 1-A`<br>

(Note that if the values of `A` and `B` are restricted to be false or true, then the logical operators work as they are conventionally defined.) PSL provides an interface in the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a> programming language for users to declaratively encode their knowledge of a particular domain in soft logic. 

These logical formulas are used as features of a Markov network, and each are associated with a weight in order to statistically model the interactions among them. The weights could either be specified manually or be learned from data with PSL's suite of learning algorithms. PSL also provides sophisticated inference techniques for finding the most likely answer to a user's query. The softening of the logical formulas allows the inference problem to be cast as a polynomial-time optimization problem rather than as a (much more difficult NP-hard) combinatorial one.
