After [[building and installing| building-psl]] the PSL software we are now ready to run an example PSL program.  PSL examples are found in the psl-examples package.  Inside this package you will find the `ExternalFunctionExample.groovy` example.  First, navigate to the parent directory of the `ExternalFunctionExample.groovy` example:  
  

````
>> cd <local path to psl-examples>/src/main/java/edu/umd/cs/psl/example/external  
````     
  
Here, you will find `ExternalFunctionExample.groovy`.  This example provides an instance of calling an external Java [[function]] from within the [[groovy psl | Psl-groovy-syntax]] syntax.
