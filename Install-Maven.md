PSL uses [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) to manage builds and dependencies. Users should [install Maven 3.x](http://maven.apache.org/download.html). PSL is developed with Maven and PSL programs are created as Maven projects. See [running Maven](http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html) for help using Maven to build projects.
