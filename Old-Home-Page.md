Welcome to the wiki for the PSL software from the University of Maryland. 

[Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)](https://psl.umiacs.umd.edu) is a machine learning framework for developing probabilistic models. PSL models are easy and fast: you can define them using a straightforward logical syntax and solve them with fast convex optimization. PSL has produced state-of-the-art results in many areas spanning natural language processing, social-network analysis, and computer vision.
